by increasing the complexity of the rules, which is a much more difficult task. In particular, there is a 
limit to the complexity of ___1___ based on hand-crafted rules, beyond which the ___1___ become more and

Two examples: an ___1___ ___3___ trial in Singapore and the potential impact of driverless taxis in 
New York  City. Parallel autonomy is when a ___2___ corrects a driverÂ´s errors by making small adjustments,        
such as turning the wheeel to ensure safety. '''

takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.'''
